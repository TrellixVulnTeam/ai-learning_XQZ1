## ai-learning

- (1) Collect some famous opensource projects of AI: adding them by a submodule of git in 'resources' folder
- (2) Try to refactor some projects or add some comments or do some experiments for learning them deeply: adding my codes in 'content' folder

- 2020-3: Learning and trying to refactor ELECTRA 
**ELECTRA** is a new method for self-supervised language representation learning. 
It can be used to pre-train transformer networks using relatively little compute. 
ELECTRA models are trained to distinguish "real" input tokens vs "fake" input tokens generated by another neural network, 
similar to the discriminator of a [GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf). 
At small scale, ELECTRA achieves strong results even when trained on a single GPU. 
At large scale, ELECTRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the [SQuAD 2.0](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) dataset.

For a detailed description and experimental results, please refer to our paper 
[ELECTRA: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather Than Generators](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1xMH1BtvB).

This repository contains code to pre-train ELECTRA, including small ELECTRA models on a single GPU. 
It also supports fine-tuning ELECTRA on downstream tasks including classification tasks (e.g,. [GLUE](https://gluebenchmark.com/)), 
QA tasks (e.g., [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)), 
and sequence tagging tasks (e.g., [text chunking](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2000/chunking/)).
